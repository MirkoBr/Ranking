# Measure fencing skill progress


This is a small side project where I track the weekly pool results of our local fencing club. The results are integrated into an overall ranking, as well as meta-analysis and atheltic head-to-head comparisons. Results data is stored in Excel sheets, the dashboard is based on R-shiny.

Here are some screenshots from the dashboard. The interactive live version can be found [here](https://mbrueggemann.shinyapps.io/TFC-Ranking/#).
